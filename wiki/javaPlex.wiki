#summary Overview of the javaPlex project.

= Welcome to javaPlex =

javaPlex is the newest member of the family of persistent homology computation libraries developed at Stanford. The impetus for developing javaPlex was a perceived lack of flexibility in the predecessor, jPlex. While jPlex is (and remains) a really fast library, the optimizations used made it hard to extend the library to new tasks.

In addition to keeping extensibility as a watchword through the development, javaPlex is released under a BSD license, and we encourage other researchers and hobbyists in persistent homology and computational topology to submit suggestions and patches to extend javaPlex further.
